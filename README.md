# Presidential AI Challenge!
Making an AI solution helping people (particularly teenagers) understand what they are consuming by looking at ingredient labels!

You've likely heard of the saying that you shouldn't eat something if you can't pronounce the ingredients, but my program tries to actually teach people about what they are putting into their bodies. I was inspired about my unhealthy energy drink addiction for this project - at first, I used to think that energy drinks were simply just a better tasting alternative to coffee with only caffeine in it. However, I learned about other added ingredients including legal stimulants like guarana, taurine, and L-carnitine which can be unhealthy, harming the heart and nervous system.
